## Find a Friend App Mockup

Our team is working on a new app called Find a Friend. We have a mockup of the app that we need to implement. We have already created some components and stories for them. We need you to finish the implementation of the app by creating the remaining components and stories for them.

Each component has a corresponding image that shows how it should look. You can find the images in the `public/mockups` folder.

You can view the mockup document [here](public/mockups/README.md). Have this page open while you work on the project.

We will use storybook to visually test components in isolation. Working on components in isolation will make it easier to develop and test components.

Be sure to complete the component before adding it to your page. Once you have completed a component, add it to the `pages/index.js` or `pages/about.js` file if it is not there already.

## Getting Started

First, clone the repository.

Then, install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Finally, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Storybook

To run storybook, run the following command:

```bash
npm run storybook
```

Open [http://localhost:6006](http://localhost:6006) with your browser to see the result.

## TODOS

- [ ] Commit after each component (with stories) is completed.
- [ ] Add additional stories for existing components.
- [ ] Create stories for components that don't have stories yet. (PetCallToAction and PetHeroImage)
- [ ] Create an about page.
- [ ] Create three more components and stories for them for your about page. (SecondaryImage, PetAboutText, and PetCard)
- [ ] Add PropTypes for the props of all components so storybook can find them.
